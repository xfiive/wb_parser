An application on Spring, working with telegram-bot-api to parsing products from wildberries.com and then sending them to the user in the bot.

NO COMMERCIAL PROFIT, free for distribution and modification.

Made only for convenience and learning certain technologies.

Technology stack: Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data, MongoDB, Jsoup (no longer relevant, as the site for parsing generated code through JS and had to abandon this technology), probably Selenium.

Well, after several nights of searching, I still haven't solved my problems with Selenium. 
I ran into the 
```java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: ‘java.io.OutputStream org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriverService$Builder.getLogOutput(java.lang.String)’ ```
problem like a river into rocks( 

I tried everything I could find on the Internet and GitHub threads with questions including, but I never came to an answer.

I am freezing this project until better times.
